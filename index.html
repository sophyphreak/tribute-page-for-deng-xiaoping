<h4>Here's a timeline of Deng Xiaoping's life:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>1904 -</b> Born in Sichuan, China</li>
  <li><b>1919 -</b> Went to France to participate in a work-study program that would change the lives of him and many others.</li>
  <li><b>1920 -</b> Ate a lot of tasty French food and got a little chubby.</li>
  <li><b>1921 -</b> Joins the Chinese Communist Youth League in Europe.</li>
  <li><b>1924 -</b> Joins the Chinese Communist Party.</li>
  <li><b>1926 -</b> Travels to the Soviet Union and studies at Moscow Sun Yat-sen University.</li>
  <li><b>1927 -</b> Returns to China. Joins the Communists in Xi'an.</li>
  <li><b>1929 -</b> Participated in the military campaign in Guangxi.</li>
  <li><b>1931 -</b> Takes over as the secretary of the Party Committee in one of the most important cities in the Soviet zone, Ruijin.</li>
  <li><b>1933 - </b>Becomes the director of the propaganda department of the Provincial Party Committee in Jiangxi.</li>
  <li><b>1934 - </b>As the Kuomindang army bears down on Jiangxi, the Commmunists decide to evacuate and begin The Long March. 100,000 men managed to escape Jiangxi, but only between 8,000 and 9,000 people survived and reached the northern province of Shaanxi.</li>
  <li><b>1937 - </b>The Japanese invade China, and the Communists and the Kuomindang form another alliance in order to defend the country. Deng stays in the area bordering the provinces of Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei.</li>
  <li><b>1945 - </b>The Japanese defeated, Deng travels to Chongqing, where the Kuomindang had established their government during the Japanese invasion. There he participated in peace talks between the communists and the Kuomindang. The talks failed, and soon hostilities began once again</li>
  <li><b>1949 - </b>Due to Deng's long history with the party, his participation in the Long March, and his early support of Mao, he was made mayor of Chongqing in November after the Communists took the city from the Kuomindang.</li>
  <li><b>1952 - </b>Deng moves to Beijing where he takes up a position in the central government as Vice Premier and Deputy Chair of the Committee on Finance. Soon after he became the Minister of Finance and the Director of the Office of Communications.</li>
  <li><b>1950s - </b></li>Deng, acting as Secretary General of the Secretariat, joins with Liu Shaoqi to reform the economy after the disasterous Great Leap Forward.
  <li><b>1961 - </b>Deng makes his famous pronouncement, "it doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, if it catches mice it is a good cat." This will get him into trouble later.</li>
  <li><b>Early 1960s - </b>Mao labels Liu and Deng as the "capitalist-roaders" faction within the Communist Party.</li>
  <li><b>1968 - </b>Red Guards through Deng's oldest son out of a four-story building, making his son a paraplegic.</li>
  <li><b>1969 - </b>Deng is sent to the Xinjian County Tractor Factory to work as a regular worker.</li>
  <li><b>1974 - </b>Deng becomes one of the most influential of the remaining army leaders. As Zhou Enlai dies, he successfully persuades Mao to bring Deng back into politics as First Vice-Premier.</li>
  <li><b>1975 - </b>Deng ends up on the bad side of The Gang of Four, and is asked to draw up a series of self-criticisms. Mao does not accept them.</li>
  <li><b>1976 - </b>The Gang of Four begin the so-called "Criticize Deng and Oppose the Rehabilitation of Right-leaning Elements" campaign. They later blame Deng for the Tiananmen Incident.</li>
  <li><b>1977 - </b>With the death of Mao, the Gang of Four quickly lose power and Deng becomes the de facto leader of China. Deng is elevated to the positions of Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee, Vice-Chairman of the Military Commission, and Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army. Deng repudiates the Cultural Revolution and ushers in the "Beijing Spring," allowing open criticism of the Cultural Revolution. He also relaxes rules keeping people designated as part of the old "landlord class" from holding more prominent roles, and many of them enter the Communist Party. Both of these reforms strengthen the position of Deng and others who were openly criticized during the Mao years.</li>
  <li><b>1978 - </b>The "Opening Up" of the country begins, which continues until the present day.</li>
  <li><b>1979 - </b>Deng goes to the United States and meets with President Jimmy Carter.</li>
  <li><b>1980 - </b>Deng ousts Hua, Mao's official successor, from office. Unlike leaders before him, he lets Hua to retain membership in the Central Committee and quietly retire, helping set a precedent that losing a high-level leadership struggle would not result in physical harm.</li>
  <li><b>1982 - </b>The Central Committee of the Communist Party releases a document making clear how the party sees Mao. Mao retains his status as a "great Marxist, proletarian revolutionary, militarist, and general", and the undisputed founder and pioneer of the country and the People's Liberation Army. The document also steered the primary responsibility for the Cultural Revolution away from Mao and toward the Gang of Four. Deng later said personally that Mao was "seven parts good, three parts bad." Deng also begins the One Child Policy to stem population growth.</li>
  <li><b>1984 - </b>Deng successfully negotiates the return of Hong Kong from the UK to China by 1997.</li>
  <li><b>1987 - </b>Deng successfully negotiates the return of Macau from Portugal to China by 1999.</li>
  <li><b>1989 - </b>Everyone went on vacation this year. Yes the journalists went on vacation. Yes the historians went on vacation. Yes the whole year long.</li>
  <li><b>1992 - </b>Deng officially retires from the public scene, but is still believed to have backroom control. He also did a tour in Guangzhou, Zhuhai, and Shenzhen, championing his economic reforms. He even stated that "leftist" elements in China were much more dangerous than "rightist" ones.</li>
  <li><b>1997 - </b>Deng dies of a lung infection and Parkinson's disease.</li>
